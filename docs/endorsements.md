# Interoperability Endorsements

Members of decentralized identity communities, such as W3C, DIF, HyperLedger, etc... may be familar with the rapidly evolving nature of specifications, working groups and concrete implementations.

In an effort to focus the technical demonstrations of interoperability, we are experimenting with the concept of an "Interoperability Endorsement".

The intention is to draw attention to specific specifications and implementations that support interoperability and that are leveraged in the technical Proof Of Concepts contained in this repository.

In order for an an endorsement to be given the following criterial SHOULD be met:

1. There exists a publicly accessible, open source contributable, specification of the concept.
2. There exists at least a single concrete implementation of the technology, which is also publically accessible and open source contribution ready.
3. There exists a demonstration of interoperability (prefferably in functioning code).

Endorsements are not limited to repos within the communities mentioned above.
